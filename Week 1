# 🧠 Daily Pentesting Notes – Omni’s Hacker Journal

## 🔥 Today’s Focus
IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)  
Burp Suite Intercept  
DVWA Setup + Exploitation

---

## ✅ What I Practiced Today
- Set up DVWA and MySQL  
- Enabled Apache & DB services  
- Found Authorization Bypass → IDOR  
- Used Burp Browser correctly  
- Captured POST requests  
- Modified `id` parameter to escalate access  
- Successfully exploited an IDOR vulnerability  

---

## 🛠️ Burp Suite Workflow
1. Open Burp → Proxy → Intercept  
2. **Intercept OFF** while loading pages  
3. Use **Open Browser** (NOT Firefox)  
4. Navigate to DVWA  
5. Turn **Intercept ON**  
6. Click “Update” to capture POST request  
7. Edit values → Forward  

---

## 🎯 IDOR Exploit Example
**Captured request:**  
```
{
  "id": 3,
  "first_name": "Hack",
  "surname": "Me"
}
```

**Edited to:**  
```
"id": 1
```

➡️ Unauthorized profile change = IDOR exploit success.

## 🎓 What I Learned
- Changing the `id` changes WHICH USER the server updates  
- Backend trusts the user-controlled ID  
- No access control = security failure  
- Burp Browser is needed for intercept  
- IDOR = easy account takeover

## 🧪 Daily Practice Checklist
- [ ] Capture POST/GET requests  
- [ ] Modify parameters  
- [ ] Test horizontal privilege escalation  
- [ ] Test vertical escalation (user → admin)  
- [ ] Try hidden parameters (JSON/cookies)  
- [ ] Look for predictable IDs

## 🚀 Tomorrow’s Training Goals
- XSS Reflected  
- CSRF  
- File Upload Bypass  
- SQLi basics  
- More IDOR variations (cookies, APIs)

---

## 💼 Bug Bounty Notes
- IDOR often pays **$500–$5,000**  
- Proof requires:  
  ✔ Ability to modify another user’s data  
  ✔ Evidence (screenshots/body)  
  ✔ Explanation of impact  
- Report clearly & professionally
