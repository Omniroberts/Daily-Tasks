# 🐧 Day 2 – Linux Essentials & System Awareness

This folder contains all work from **Day 2** of my pentesting journey.
Focus: *Linux fundamentals, filesystem navigation, permissions, processes, and services.*

## 📌 Goals for Day 2

- Understand the Linux filesystem structure  
- Navigate using the terminal  
- Learn basic file + directory commands  
- View and manage processes  
- Understand permissions (rwx)  
- Understand users, groups, and ownership  
- Learn how Linux services run  
- Begin light bash muscle memory

# 📘 Day 2 – Linux Basics

## ⭐ Linux Filesystem Structure

Important directories:

- `/home` → user files  
- `/etc` → configuration files  
- `/var` → logs, server data  
- `/usr` → installed software  
- `/bin` → essential system commands  
- `/opt` → optional applications  

---

## ⭐ Basic Linux Commands

ls → list files
cd → change directory
pwd → show current directory
mkdir → create folder
touch → create file
cp → copy file
mv → move/rename file
rm → delete file

yaml
Copy code

## ⭐ Permissions (rwx)

Format:
r = read
w = write
x = execute

makefile
Copy code

Example:
-rwxr-x---

Broken down:
- user: rwx  
- group: r-x  
- others: ---

## ⭐ Changing Permissions

chmod 755 file
chmod +x script.sh

---

## ⭐ Ownership

chown user:group file

## ⭐ Processes & Services

ps aux → list processes
systemctl → manage services

## ⭐ Package Management

sudo apt update
sudo apt install <package>

# 📁 Day 2 – Filesystem Navigation Commands

## Commands Practiced

```bash
pwd
ls -la
cd /home
mkdir testdir
touch testfile.txt
cp testfile.txt testdir/
mv testfile.txt renamedfile.txt
rm renamedfile.txt
Notes
I learned how to move around the Linux filesystem.

I practiced creating, moving, copying, and deleting files/folders.

ls -la shows hidden files and permissions.

# 🔐 Permissions & Ownership Commands – Day 2

## Commands Used

```bash
ls -l
chmod 755 testfile.txt
chmod +x script.sh
chown root:root testfile.txt
sudo chown $USER:$USER testfile.txt
Notes
Understanding rwx is key for privilege escalation.

chmod +x makes a file executable.

Ownership controls who can access or modify files.

# 🧩 Processes & Services – Day 2

## Commands Used

```bash
ps aux
top
systemctl status ssh
systemctl start ssh
systemctl stop apache2
Notes
I can now check running processes.

I learned how services are controlled on Linux.

This is essential for finding misconfigurations during pentests.

# 📦 Package Management – Day 2

## Commands Used

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nmap
sudo apt install net-tools
Notes
Installing tools is part of real pentesting.

apt update refreshes package lists.

apt install adds new tools to Kali.

# 📝 Day 2 – Hands-On Linux Tasks

## Task 1 — Navigate Linux
- Move into `/home`
- Create a folder
- Create a file inside it
- Rename the file
- Delete it

## Task 2 — Permissions
- Create a file called `runme.sh`
- Add text inside (echo "hello world")
- Make it executable using:
chmod +x runme.sh

markdown
Copy code

## Task 3 — Processes
- Use `ps aux` to find:
  - The ssh service
  - The top 5 memory-heavy processes

## Task 4 — Services
- Check if SSH service is active:
systemctl status ssh

powershell
Copy code

## Task 5 — Install a package
Install netcat or curl:
sudo apt install netcat

# 🔍 Day 2 – Why Linux Skills Matter for Bug Bounty

Most bug bounty programs run Linux servers.

Understanding Linux helps you:
- Read server config files
- Understand web app deployment
- Analyze permissions issues
- Identify misconfigurations
- Recognize dangerous service settings
- Understand log files
- Exploit poorly configured cron jobs
- Detect insecure file permissions

Becoming comfortable in Linux = becoming dangerous as a hacker.

# 🌙 Day 2 – Reflection & Summary

## What I Learned Today
- Basics of Linux filesystem
- How permissions work
- How to use chmod and chown
- How services run in Linux
- How to install packages

## What Was Easy
- Navigation and basic commands

## What Was Hard
(Add any confusion here)

## What I Want to Review Tomorrow
- More on permissions
- Understanding systemctl better

## Final Thoughts
Today built my Linux foundation — I feel more confident in the terminal. 🐧⚡
