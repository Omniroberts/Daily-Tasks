# 🌅 Day 1 – Networking Fundamentals & Light Recon

This folder contains all work from **Day 1** of my pentesting journey.  
Focus: *Networking basics, core recon commands, and bug bounty mindset.*

---

## 📌 Goals for Day 1

- Understand basic networking concepts:
  - IP address
  - Public vs private IPs
  - Gateway
  - Subnet basics
  - TCP vs UDP
- Run essential commands:
  - `ip a`
  - `ping`
  - `traceroute`
  - `ss -tulpn`
- Begin bug bounty pattern recognition
- Document everything like a real pentester

# 📘 Day 1 – Networking Basics

## ⭐ What is an IP Address?
A unique address assigned to a device on a network.

- Example IPv4: `192.168.1.20`
- Example IPv6: `fe80::f2de:f1ff:fe3b:1234`

---

## ⭐ Public vs Private IPs

**Public IP** → internet-facing  
**Private IP** → inside your home or local network  

Common private ranges:
- `192.168.x.x`
- `10.x.x.x`
- `172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x`

---

## ⭐ What Is a Gateway?
The router → the device that sends traffic from inside your network to the internet.

---

## ⭐ What Is a Subnet?
A slice of a network.  
Examples:
- `/24` = standard home network
- `/16` = larger network
- `/8`  = massive network

---

## ⭐ TCP vs UDP
- **TCP:** reliable, handshake (SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK)
- **UDP:** fast, no handshake

---

## ⭐ Essential Day 1 Commands

ip a
ping
traceroute
ss -tulpn

These commands form the foundation of all future pentesting.


📁 commands/ip-a-output.md
# 🖥️ `ip a` Output – Day 1

## Purpose
To identify:
- local IP address
- active interface
- subnet
- MAC address

## Output
(Paste your real terminal output here)

## Notes
- Active interface:
- Local IP:
- Subnet:


📁 commands/ping-output.md
# 📡 `ping` Output – Day 1

## Purpose
Check if a target host is alive.

## Command
```bash
ping <target-ip>

Output
(Paste your real ping results here)

# 📁 **`commands/traceroute-output.md`**

```markdown
# 🛰️ `traceroute` Output – Day 1

## Purpose
See how many hops it takes to reach a host.

## Command
```bash
traceroute <target-ip>

Output
(Paste your traceroute results here)
Notes


Number of hops:


Slow or unusual hops:



---

# 📁 **`commands/ss-netstat-output.md`**

```markdown
# 🔎 `ss -tulpn` Output – Day 1

## Purpose
View active local ports, services, and processes.

## Command
```bash
ss -tulpn

Output
(Paste your ss results here)

# 📁 **`bug-bounty/day01-observations.md`**

```markdown
# 🔐 Day 1 – Bug Bounty Parameter Observations

Goal: Begin noticing URL patterns used in IDOR, access control bugs, etc.

---

## URLs Observed Today

| Date | Site | URL / Parameter | Notes |
|------|------|------------------|-------|
|      |      |                  |       |

Look for patterns like:
- `?id=123`
- `?user=44`
- `/api/v1/`
- `/profile/99`

---

## Notes
- Today I focused on spotting query parameters.
- Building pattern awareness early helps with IDOR hunting later.

# 🌙 Day 1 – Reflection & Summary

## What I Learned Today
- Basic networking concepts
- How to find my own IP
- How to see packet paths with traceroute
- How to check running services with ss
- The role of ports in communication

---

## What Was Easy
- Running commands
